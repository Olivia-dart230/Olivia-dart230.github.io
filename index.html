        <p>Even though you may not like it</p>
        <p>The reflection is always <em>you.</em></p>
        <h6>If you try to hide from it...</h6>
        <p>You will find yourself feeling <strong>blue.</strong></p>
        <p>The glass will reflect</p>
        <p>What is on the outside,</p>
        <p>But what you should project</p>
        <p>Are your feelings on the inside.</p>
        <p>Don't let the <em>truth</em> subside.</p>
